Title: Tower and Enemy Game
 
 This game was an assignment for a course on Data types and object-oriented programming in C++ during my exchange at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

All of the code in the files with 'TODO' in name was written by me, other ones were provided by my course coordinators. 

In order to play, download the whole repository with all the files and folders. Afterwards execute the file Tower_game.exe. (On a mac do it through terminal with command ./Tower_game.exe).

About the game:

This is a game during which some enemies will be generated at each turn. These enemies are heading towards the end-zone. If any enemy reaches the end-zone, the game ends. You are asked to build some towers to destroy these enemies. Different types of enemies behave differently and different types of towers work differently. Both towers and enemies are modeled by an abstract base class Object. 

I am planning a further development of the game which would include rendering it in Qt.
